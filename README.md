# AWS-CICD-Project
This diagram represents a CI/CD pipeline where code changes pushed to GitHub trigger an automated process that builds, stores, and deploys the application on AWS infrastructure.

Cloud9: It's an aws service that helps in integrated development environment (IDE) that allows developers to write, run, and debug code in a browser.

GitHub: It's a version control platform that hosts repositories, enabling developers to push, pull, and manage their code.

AWS CodePipeline: It's a CI/CD service that automates the build, test, and deployment phases of application releases.

AWS CodeBuild: A fully managed build service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces deployable artifacts.

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): A cloud storage service used to store artifacts generated by CodeBuild.

AWS CodeDeploy: It's a deployment service that automates application deployment to Amazon EC2 instances or other AWS services.

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): It's a cloud-based virtual server used to host applications and provide compute capacity.

IAM (Identity and Access Management) role: A security service that manages permissions and access controls for AWS resources.

User: The end-user who accesses the deployed application running on EC2 instances.
